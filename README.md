# Emergency-Scraper
A Web Scraping and Automation Project that provides a list of emergency numbers and calling codes around the world. 
- I extracted the data from the Web using Selenium.
- I am done with the Data manipulation and Wrangling process.
- I am currently planning on commencing the Automation process.

## About
- I was able to scrape the data from a compilation list set by [Joe Connor](https://www.adducation.info/profile/joe-connor/) on this [Webpage](https://www.adducation.info/general-knowledge-travel-and-transport/emergency-numbers/).
- It contains list of Emergency Numbers 🆘 & 📞 Calling Codes Around the World ☎️📱 including the local/in-country emergency telephone numbers for the police, ambulance and fire services for countries/territories worldwide.

#### Fun facts
- In some countries it’s possible to make emergency calls without a SIM card installed. For example the UK, Germany, Belgium, France, Cyprus, Romania, Slovenia and others
- 112 and 911 emergency numbers are universal emergency numbers.
